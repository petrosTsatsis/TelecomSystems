# Telecommunication Systems using Python

 In the first part of the project , I compared the Qfunction with 3 approximate functions and create a function to find the inverse Qfunction 
 and in the second part i created waveforms using Q-PAM. To run this project you will need : 

# Python

# Numpy
# Scipy
# Matplotlib.pyplot
